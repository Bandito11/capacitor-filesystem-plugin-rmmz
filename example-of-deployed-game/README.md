This should only be used as a guide for the structure of your game for a `Capacitor` app. The node packages in the `package.json` should be updated to the latest version. 

The `capacitor.config.json` could be later changed to any other format, so follow the instructions on the [official capacitor docs](https://capacitorjs.com/docs). Same can be said about [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) or [Cheerio](https://cheerio.js.org/docs/api).

The `www` is the default path for `capacitor` and could be changed to any name you want.
